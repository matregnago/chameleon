 *  matrix A. The factorization has the form
 *
 *    \f[ A = L \times L^H, \f]
 *    or
 *    \f[ A = U^H \times U, \f]
 *
 *  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular matrix.

 *          - ChamLower: Lower triangle of A is stored.
 *
 * @param[in] N
 *          The order of the matrix A. n >= 0.

 *          contains the upper triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly
 *          lower triangular part of A is not referenced.
 *          If uplo = ChamLower, the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A
 *          contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly
